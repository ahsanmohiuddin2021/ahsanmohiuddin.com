## Welcome to Ahsan's Website

Born in 1982. A crossover between GenX and Millennials. I like to keep things informal and yet, get straight to the point. Reach out to me if you think I can help you. With my 40th Birthday fast approaching, I realise how short life is, and that in serving others there is satisfaction, respect and &#36;&#36;&#36; (though sometimes the &#36;&#36; doesn’t materialise.. which is part of the game coz sometimes "Journey is the reward" *eyeroll*)

Below some free tips from Github Pages:

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ahsanmohiuddin2021/ahsanmohiuddin.com/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ahsanmohiuddin2021/ahsanmohiuddin.com/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
